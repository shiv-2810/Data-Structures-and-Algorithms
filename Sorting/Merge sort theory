* Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, it firsts divide the array or input list in two parts
and then it recursively sort these two parts and after sorting these two parts
it merges them.

* The good thing about merge sort is that it is a stable sorting algorithm
it maintains the original order of equal items.

* Time( theta nlogn) Space(n) aux space.

* There is a variant of merge sort called Block merge sort that does emplace sorting.

* ussed in external sorting
*does not as good as quick sort for arrays
